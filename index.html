        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Matthew Nguyen and I am currently a 1st-year Pre-Business student at the University of California, Riverside! I plan on concentrating in Accounting and plan on pursuing my MBA in the near future.

Some of the things I enjoy doing in my free time include personal fitness and wellbeing, hip hop dancing, enjoying new food, and meeting new people! Additionally, I have a great passion for sustainability and environmentalism which I will mention later in my bio. I am blessed to have been raised by an amazing single mother who helped build and create the person you see today. I canâ€™t emphasize how much time, effort, and love she put in raising me and I am incredibly grateful for all the help she has given me and the opportunities that sheâ€™s encouraged me to take. Without her, I would not be able to say that I am quite the person you would see today. In fact, it was through her motivation and personal passion for preparing me for adulthood that I was able to find my greatest passion after leaving high school, business finance. 

In addition to business finance, I am also interested in personal finance and investing in sectors such as index funds and real estate. Apart from business, I am also passionate about environmental sustainability, and I hope to find a job that can not only fulfill my personal desires but also serve a higher purpose to the world as well. As an accountant, I want to be able to work for a company that works for me, and for one where I am able to see and feel the direct impact of my actions in the journey for the wellbeing of others. 

Ever since my mom taught me about personal financial literacy, I've found a passion for handling and optimizing my money. Right when I turned 18 in the summer, I've been pursuing my passion for finance through learning the mechanics behind excel sheets, researching personal investment strategies, and putting money in the stock market through index funds and individual stocks.  Additionally, Iâ€™ve made it a priority to begin my professional experience in finance as soon as possible, and thus I am currently serving as the Chair of Finance for my universityâ€™s chapter of Management Information Systems Society. To add, I am an active member of my schoolâ€™s Beta Alpha Psi, which is an accounting and finance honors organization. 
My goals for my post-college future are to become a CPA for one of the Big 4 accounting firms in the US and eventually serve as the Chief Financial Officer for a company that has a mission that aligns with my morals and individuality.  Although I may be a first-year in college, I hope that my individual motivation and passion for this field can truly make an impact in the world. 

I am always searching for opportunities to grow and learn, and while I have a long road ahead of me, I can't help but be ecstatically excited for what's to come.
